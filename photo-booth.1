.SH DESCRIPTION

.B photo-booth
uses a video capture device to simulate a buttonless photo booth.  To
get the booth's attention, start waving your arms and jumping around.
Watch the thermometer in the corner, and smile when the sensor is
tripped.  Four shots will be taken a few seconds apart, and a montage
displayed for your satisfaction.  You should hear sound effects that
indicate operation mode, and see some brief on-screen text.

To quit the application, type "q" while it is idle.
